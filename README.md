# better-ttb

UofT timetable builder monorepo.

A fast, keyboard-friendly builder for University of Toronto (St. George) Arts &
Science course timetables, running on Cloudflare Workers.

## Features

- **Builder** (`/`) — searchable course catalog with rich filters, a course
  detail sheet, and per-plan course pinning with section selection and conflict
  detection.
- **Timetable** (`/timetable`) — Fall/Winter week grid, a schedule generator
  with a rule editor, candidate gallery, and preview/apply, plus share, JSON
  export/import, and ICS export.
- **Map** (`/map`) — Leaflet campus map with day-by-day walking routes and tight
  transfer warnings.
- **Shared plans** (`/p/$id`) — read-only view of a shared plan.
- Light / dark / system theme with no-flash startup.

## Setup

This repo uses pnpm (pinned via the `packageManager` field). If pnpm isn't on
your PATH, run `corepack enable` once — modern Node ships with Corepack.

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Commands

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm alchemy
```

`apps/web` is a TanStack Start app targeting Cloudflare Workers through Alchemy. The build script uses plain `vite build`; Alchemy resource deployment is handled by `pnpm alchemy`.

The Alchemy Vite plugin requires Alchemy's generated `.alchemy/local/wrangler.jsonc`. Standalone `pnpm build` skips that plugin; `pnpm alchemy` enables it through Alchemy's build environment.

## Deploy

Deployment provisions the Worker, D1 database, and KV namespace via Alchemy.

One-time setup: `pnpm exec alchemy configure` (select Cloudflare, OAuth login), then
create a root `.env` (gitignored) with:

```
ADMIN_TOKEN=<secret>        # guards the scrape endpoint
ALCHEMY_PASSWORD=<secret>   # encrypts secrets in Alchemy state — keep stable across deploys
```

Then:

```sh
set -a && source .env && set +a && pnpm run deploy
```

(Use `pnpm run deploy`, not `pnpm deploy` — the latter is pnpm's built-in
deploy command, not this script.)

Note: deploy must go through the `alchemy` CLI (the pnpm script does), not plain
`tsx alchemy.run.ts` — the CLI generates `.alchemy/local/wrangler.jsonc`, which
the Alchemy Vite plugin requires during the build.
After the first deploy the catalog is empty — populate it by calling the admin
scrape endpoint (also run daily by the configured cron):

```sh
curl -X POST https://<your-worker>/api/admin/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## Architecture

Turborepo workspace: a TanStack Start (React 19 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui) app
in `apps/web` with server routes on Cloudflare Workers (D1 + KV), sharing
`@better-ttb/shared` types and the `@better-ttb/generator` scheduling engine.

### Walking distances and routes

Back-to-back class walkability uses real pedestrian durations rather than
straight-line estimates:

- `tools/walk-matrix.json` (vendored to `apps/web/src/data/walk-matrix.json`) is
  a precomputed `codes × codes` matrix of foot-profile walking seconds between
  every UTSG building, generated from the OSRM foot profile at
  `routing.openstreetmap.de` (FOSSGIS). The web app flattens the relevant pairs
  into the generator's `walkSeconds` config; the `@better-ttb/generator` package
  stays data-free and falls back to a haversine estimate for unknown pairs.
- The `/api/walk-route` worker route fetches live walking geometry from the same OSRM
  service on demand and caches it permanently in KV (`route:v1:<from>:<to>`); the
  `/map` view draws these routes and falls back to a dashed straight line on
  failure.
- UofT classes start 10 minutes after their listed time
  (`UOFT_TRANSFER_GRACE_MINUTES` in `@better-ttb/shared`), so transfer
  feasibility is judged against `(next listed start + 10 min) − prev listed end`.
